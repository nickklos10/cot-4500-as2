#Overview
This script is designed to perform various numerical interpolation methods, including divided differences, Newton's divided difference interpolation, Hermite polynomial interpolation, and cubic spline interpolation.

#Features
Divided Differences: Calculate divided differences for a set of data points.
Newton's Interpolation: Implement Newton's divided difference method for interpolation.
Hermite Interpolation: Use both function values and derivatives for Hermite interpolation.
Cubic Spline Interpolation: Compute cubic spline coefficients for piecewise interpolation.

#Prerequisites
- Python
- NumPy

#Usage
Clone or download the script to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the script's directory.
Run the script: python assignment_2.py.
To customize, modify the input data points and function values as needed.

#Customization
Input data points and function values can be changed directly in the script to apply the methods to different datasets.
